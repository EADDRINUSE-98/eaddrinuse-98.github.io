# About me
I'm Priyanshu Singh, a B.Tech student in India, deeply immersed in the world of cybersecurity. My CS background has provided a solid foundation, and I spend most of my time expanding my knowledge and skills. I'm proficient in Linux command line, Bash and Python scripting, network analysis, subnetting, iptables/ufw, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning (using Nmap), and packet analysis (using Wireshark and tcpdump).

I've developed several personal projects to solidify my understanding of network concepts, including a port scanner using the Nmap library in Python, basic server-client programs in C, and a multi-featured CLI utility using Scapy. Furthermore, I also actively participate in CTFs to refine my skills.

I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and learning alongside others in the cybersecurity community. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the field and secure an entry level role where I can focus on network security.
